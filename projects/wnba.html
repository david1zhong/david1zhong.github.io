  <h5>Date, player name, team name, model name, model predicted points, actual player points, over line, under line, over odds, under odds, bet made by model, actual result of bet, points differential (actual points - predicted points), performance note, bet amount, and bet profit are collected in the table (PostgreSQL, SupaBase). </h5>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>I was inspired by this satirical theory I saw online, where degenerative gamblers, like myself, speculated the possibility and practicality of betting on over/under points on WNBA players by analyzing their menstrual cycle.</p>
  
  <p>Putting my thinking cap on, I decided to take this a step further. I wanted to find how difficult it would be for someone who has 0 knowledge in coding or development to be able to generate information. Let's see how well today's top cutting edge Artificial Intelligence models can predict. </p>
  
  <h3>How it Works</h3>
  <p>The predicted points, bet, performance note, and bet amount are generated by popularily accessible AI models like Claude and ChatGPT. They were prompted to identify patterns in the player's performance, and identify recurring dips in points or field goal percentage at around the same time frame every month, indicating menstruation. Using this information, a forecast of strength and weakness could emerge. <b>Again, it is important to mention there is no scientific link between athletic performance and the menstrual cycle.</b></p>
  
  <h3>Pipeline</h3>
  <img src="../public/wnba-pipeline.webp" width="50%" height="50%">
  
  <h3>Ideas I Would Like to Pursue</h3>
  <p>Extension 1.A: Get the model to generate a dollar amount, $1-$5, and make that amount the hypothetical amount they would put on their guess. If very confident, put $5, somewhat confident $1, and none if not confident at all.</p>
  
  <p>Extension 1.B: Imagine you placed $1 on every bet placed. How much profit would you make?</p>
  
  <p>Extension 2: Let the models train off the data the other models and itself have already predicted in the past, to make more informed predictions. For example, I've noticed that again and again, the models seem to underestimate and always bet the under on Las Vegas Aces' star player A'ja Wilson. Letting the models learn off of previous predictions can help them to recognize not to underestimate some players, and start to bet more in favour of the over instead of the under and vice-versa for some players. </p>
